# server-starter
This project is meant to help me and maybe others to easily set up their servers and VMs. 
I built this project for two reasons fun and helped me set up my servers easily, Since I am not a big fan of images, I asked myself why not have my own script that achieves that.

# Available distribution on
Ubuntu 18, 20, 22.

# Packages
- PHP (7.4 8.0 8.1)

# Usage
The script needs to be run using sudo, of course, check the script first and use it at your own risk. LOL
`sudo bash index.sh `

This project is open source and anyone can use it, so why not contribute, Enjoy it.
